# Python Guessing Game
This is an interactive guessing game created in Python. In the game the computer
will generate a random number that is between 1 to 10 and the user will have 
to guess correct number (generated by the computer). The user must guess the 
correct number within 5 chances. To help the user the computer will provide 
feedback (whether the guess was too high or too low), and provide how many 
attempts the user took.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

foobar.pluralize('goose')

```
