# Python Guessing Game
This is an interactive guessing game created in Python. In the game the computer
will generate a random number that is between 1 to 10 and the user will have 
to guess correct number (generated by the computer). The user must guess the 
correct number within 5 chances. To help the user the computer will provide 
feedback (whether the guess was too high or too low), and provide how many 
attempts the user took.

## Installation
Please download the code from Github and execute the python guessinggame.py 
file. There is no further installation needed.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome--but highly unlikely. For major changes, please 
open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change--which is also 
highly unlikely. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
